tenets:
  # Tenets that ensure integration tests have the correct package name, file name,
  # and custom build directive.

  # There is a test file for each possible combination of having the directive (D),
  # correct package name (P), and correct filename (F). Every combination except
  # DPF and OOO will be matched by two tenets. For example, DOO will be matched by
  # right-build-directive-wrong-file and right-build-directive-wrong-package,
  #  and OPF will be matched by right-package-wrong-build-directive and 
  # right-file-wrong-build-directive.
  # This gives a total of 12 issues.

  # There is an explicit tenet for each case. See more concise possible solutions below.
